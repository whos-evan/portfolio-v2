**Update**: I switched back to iOS...

This will be short and sweet, maybe.

Which Android engineer thought it was a good idea to treat alarms like regular notifications? Honestly, this might be the most insane, stupid decision ever made by a software engineer. I understand the principle that every app should be treated equally--but NOT the clock app.

Why am I ranting about this? Because my alarms have been silenced multiple times due to my phone being on DND (Do Not Disturb). Here’s the thing: I don’t care if I’m on DND--if I purposely set an alarm, I want to be disturbed. Seriously, who in their right mind thought, "You know what? Alarms should be silenced on DND." What???

To make matters worse, my DND preferences occasionally reset (probably when I update my phone, though not super sure), reverting to the default setting where alarms get silenced. This has caused me to miss important events twice because of this awful default setting (which I refuse to call a "feature").

Google, Android, whoever--please fix this. Alarms are inherently designed to alarm you. They should go off no matter what.

Another few bad things:
1. There is absolutely no alternative to Shortcuts for Android. (Tasker sucks)
2. The finger print reader on the Pixel 8 Pro is way too slow for my liking.
3. I miss Face ID.
4. The Pixel 8 Pro is just slower in every way compared to my old iPhone.
5. Google Gemini is a mess. It’s terrible at complex tasks (like finding niche events) and bad at basic ones (like sending a message).

Some good:
1. The camera.
2. The circle to search feature (super useful).
3. Google Assistant.
4. Sailing the high seas.
